				<center><h2>Basic Information</h2></center>

				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.</li>

						<li>Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals.</li> 

						<li>In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other.</li>

						<li>Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser.</li>

						<li>A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</li>

							<strong>Better Sleep</strong>
								<br>Fast Company suggests that exercise and sport triggers chemicals in the brain that can make you feel happier and relaxed. Team sports provide a chance to unwind and take part in an activity that improves your fitness. If you play sports outside, you can benefit from fresh air which is said to promote a good night’s sleep.</br>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>A Strong Heart</strong>
								<br>Your heart is a muscle and needs frequent exercise to help it keep fit and healthy. A healthy heart can pump blood efficiently around your body. Your heart will improve in performance when it is regularly challenged with exercise. Stronger hearts can improve overall health of the body.</br>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Improved Lung Function</strong>
								<br>Regular sport causes more oxygen to be drawn into the body with carbon monoxide and waste gases expelled. This increases the lung capacity during sport, improving lung function and efficiency.</br>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Reduces Stress</strong>
								<br>When you are physically active your mind gets a chance to unplug from daily stresses and strains of life. Physical exercise reduces the stress hormones in your body and stimulates the release of endorphins. These endorphins may give you more energy and focus for whatever life has.</br>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Improved Mental Health</strong>
								<br>The Public Health Agency report that regular participation in sport and being active can also promote good mental health. This includes improving your mood, enhancing your sense of well-being, reducing anxiety, combating negative emotions and protecting against depression.</br>

				<center><h2>A Steady Decline in Sports Participation</h2></center>

				<center>

				</center>

				<p>
					<br>It’s easy to look at the size of the kids sports industry – nearly $17 billion – and assume that it’s alive and well. However, dwindling participation rates in organized youth sports leagues tells a different story.</br>

					<br>According to a report from the Aspen Institute, the share of children ages 6 to 12 who play a team sport declined from 41.5 percent in 2011 to just 37 percent in 2017. Participation rates are lower in almost every team sport, including football, basketball, soccer, and baseball. In the latter case, participation is down roughly 20 percent!</br>

					<br>Even more alarming is the fact that participation rates get worse with age. In 2018, 56 percent of teenage girls and 48 percent of teenage boys did not participate in a sport. (Interestingly enough, there’s also a correlation to academics. Children who don’t play youth sports tend to have lower grades and are less likely to attend college.)</br>

					<br>If you study the long-term graph of youth sports participation over the past few decades, you’ll see that these declines have developed over the course of many years. However, things have recently accelerated. If nothing is done to stop this steep decline, the future of youth sports in America could be in serious jeopardy.</br>

						<li>
							<strong>Educate Parents and Children</strong>
								<br>If a parent didn’t grow up playing youth sports – or if they’re unaware of all the important benefits of playing youth sports – they might not encourage their children to participate. This is why we need a greater emphasis on the education of parents and children.</br>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Stop the Emphasis on Hyperspecialization </strong>
								<br>As athletic scholarships have become more competitive and prized among parents, many have persuaded their children to hyperspecialize in a single sport at the expense of all others. Not only does this lead to higher rates of burnout and eventual disinterest in the sport, but it also results in much higher injury rates.</br>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Lessen the Time Burden</strong>
								<br>Modern youth sports are simply too much of a time-suck. Whereas kids used to have one or two practices/games per week, many are now expected to put in hours of time each day – even during the offseason. This dissuades many children and teenagers from participating.</br>
